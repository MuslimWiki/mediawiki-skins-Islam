## Direct contributors
* **[Khalid Abdullah](https://github.com/drkhalidabdullah)** authored *Islam*.

## Indirect contributors
* **[Wikimedia Foundation Core Experiences teams](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Core_Experiences)** for their extensive design research. It drives many of the design decisions in *Islam* that would otherwise be unable to validate quantitatively.
* **Various WMF Design Systems teams** for their effort to build, maintain, and implement design systems (MWUI, OOUI, Codex) across the MediaWiki ecosystem. It significantly reduces the work needed for *Islam* to provide a cohesive design.
* **Other WMF-deployed skins such as [Citizen](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Skin:Citizen), [Vector](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Skin:Vector), [MinervaNeue](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Skin:Minerva_Neue), and [Timeless](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Skin:Timeless)** for some of the features and best practices in a MediaWiki skin. They became a part of the foundation of what *Islam* has become today.

A gigantic thank you to all the folks above! *Islam* wouldn't be here today without any of you. If someone is missing, please drop us a note and let us know!
