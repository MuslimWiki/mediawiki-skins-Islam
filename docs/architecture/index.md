# Architecture Overview

This section provides a comprehensive look at the architecture of the Islam Skin, including its design principles, data flow, and component interactions.

## Core Concepts

- **Component-Based Architecture**: The UI is built from reusable, self-contained components
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Data flows down through props, events flow up
- **Theming System**: Centralized theming with CSS custom properties
- **Accessibility First**: Built with WCAG 2.1 AA compliance in mind

## Key Documentation

### Design Patterns
- [Component Interaction](./component-interaction.md) - How components communicate
- [Component Relationships](./component-relationships.md) - Component hierarchy and dependencies
- [Data Flow](./data-flow.md) - How data moves through the application

### Styling System
- [Styling Guidelines](../reference/styling.md) - Theming and styling approach
- [Responsive Design](../reference/responsive.md) - Mobile-first responsive strategies

### Performance
- [Optimization Strategies](../reference/optimization.md) - Performance best practices
- [Lazy Loading](../reference/lazy-loading.md) - Code splitting and lazy loading

## Architectural Decisions

### Why Component-Based?
- **Reusability**: Components can be reused across the application
- **Maintainability**: Isolated components are easier to maintain
- **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation

### State Management
- Local component state for UI state
- Context API for global state
- Custom hooks for reusable stateful logic

### Styling Approach
- CSS Custom Properties for theming
- Utility-first CSS with custom properties
- BEM naming convention for components

## Best Practices

1. **Component Design**
   - Single Responsibility Principle
   - Props for configuration
   - Composition over inheritance

2. **State Management**
   - Keep state as local as possible
   - Lift state up when needed
   - Use context for truly global state

3. **Performance**
   - Memoize expensive calculations
   - Use React.memo for pure components
   - Implement proper cleanup in effects
