# Architecture

This directory contains documentation about the architecture and design of the Islam Skin.

## Core Concepts

- **Component-Based Architecture**: The UI is built using reusable components
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Data flows down, events flow up
- **Theming System**: Customizable design tokens and styles
- **Accessibility First**: Built with accessibility in mind from the ground up

## Documentation

- [Overview](./overview.md) - High-level architecture overview
- [Styling](./styling.md) - Styling architecture and theming system
- [Data Flow](./data-flow.md) - How data moves through the application
- [Component Interaction](./component-interaction.md) - How components communicate
- [Component Relationships](./component-relationships.md) - How components relate to each other

## Design Principles

1. **Modularity**: Components should be self-contained and reusable
2. **Consistency**: Follow established patterns and conventions
3. **Performance**: Optimize for fast loading and rendering
4. **Accessibility**: Meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
5. **Responsiveness**: Work on all device sizes
