## üõ† Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

- `main` - Stable, production-ready code (protected branch)
- `develop` - Integration branch for features (protected branch)
- `feature/*` - New features and enhancements
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fixes
- `docs/*` - Documentation updates
- `release/*` - Release preparation branches

### Development Workflow

1. **Local Development**:
   - Work on feature branches
   - Follow coding standards
   - Write tests for new features
   - Update documentation

2. **Code Review**:
   - Create pull requests
   - Request reviews from team members
   - Address feedback
   - Ensure all tests pass

3. **Merging**:
   - Squash and merge approved PRs
   - Delete merged branches
   - Update local repository

### Making Changes

1. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes and commit them:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
   ```

3. Push your changes:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. Create a pull request against the `develop` branch.

## üîß Development Tools

### Documentation

- Build documentation: `npm run docs:build`
- Generate search index: `npm run search:index`
- Update table of contents: `npm run toc:generate`
- Run local server: `npx serve -s .`
- Check for broken links: `npx linkinator ./**/*.md`

### Local Development Server

To run a local development server:

```bash
# Start PHP's built-in server
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

### Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
composer test
```

### Coding Standards

Before committing, ensure your code follows the project's coding standards:

```bash
composer cs-check  # Check coding standards
composer cs-fix    # Fix coding standards issues
```

## üß™ Testing

### Local Testing

Before pushing changes, run:

```bash
# Run all tests
composer test

# Run PHPUnit tests
composer test:phpunit

# Run PHPCS (coding standards)
composer cs-check

# Fix coding standards
composer cs-fix
```

### Local Testing

Run tests locally before pushing changes:

```bash
# Run all tests
composer test

# Run PHPUnit tests
composer test:phpunit

# Check coding standards
composer cs-check
```

### Browser Testing

For cross-browser testing, we recommend:

- [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/)
- [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/)

## üöÄ Building for Production

To create a production build:

```bash
# Install dependencies
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader

# Build assets
npm run build
```

This will create optimized assets in the appropriate directories.

### Versioning

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). To create a new release:

1. Update the version in `extension.json`
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md`
3. Create a git tag:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Version 1.0.0"
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```
