# Webview and Link Handling Issues

This document outlines the current issues and planned improvements for the documentation viewer's webview and link handling functionality.

## Current Issues

### 1. Webview Navigation
- Some links trigger file downloads instead of loading in the webview
- Inconsistent back/forward navigation behavior
- Active state highlighting in navigation needs improvement

### 2. URL Handling
- Path resolution requires refinement
- Base URL construction needs optimization
- Hash fragment handling could be improved
- Potential issues with trailing slashes

### 3. Performance
- Page transitions could be smoother
- Content loading might benefit from caching
- Event delegation could be optimized
- Initial load performance needs assessment

### 4. Error Handling
- Limited error states for failed content loads
- Loading indicators could be more prominent
- Missing fallback content for 404 pages
- Error recovery mechanisms needed

## Technical Debt

### Code Organization
- Navigation logic is tightly coupled with content loading
- URL normalization needs refactoring
- Event handling could be more modular

### Browser Compatibility
- Tested primarily in Chrome/Edge
- May need additional testing in Firefox and Safari
- Mobile responsiveness needs verification

## Recommended Solutions

### Short-term Fixes
1. Implement proper content type checking
2. Add loading states and error boundaries
3. Improve URL normalization
4. Add proper history management

### Long-term Improvements
1. Implement a client-side router
2. Add proper state management
3. Implement proper caching strategy
4. Add proper error boundaries and recovery

## Testing Plan

### Unit Tests Needed
- URL normalization
- Navigation state management
- Content loading and error handling

### Integration Tests
- Full navigation flow
- Back/forward button behavior
- Error scenarios

## Dependencies

- Highlight.js for code syntax highlighting
- Current routing implementation
- Browser History API

## Open Questions

1. Should we implement a proper SPA framework?
2. What are the performance requirements?
3. What browsers/versions need to be supported?
4. Are there any accessibility requirements?

## Next Steps

1. Prioritize and address critical navigation issues
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Add comprehensive testing
4. Optimize performance
5. Document the final implementation
